# This file mainly controls line ending conversion behaviour, if
# the user has the setting core.autocrlf true.

# The meaning of the attributes is a little odd
# -crlf means DO NOT convert line endings
# crlf means CONVERT to lf in the repo, but always checkout using crlf
# on all platforms

# sln is always CRLF, even on linux, so don't convert
