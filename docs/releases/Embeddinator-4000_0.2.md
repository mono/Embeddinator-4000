Known Issues
============

* This release only generates Objective-C code;
* This release only targets macOS, iOS, and tvOS - the latter requires Xamarin.iOS (10.11+) to be installed;
* Some C# features (e.g. generics) are not yet supported;
* In some cases the generator produces duplicate symbols, which won't compile. Please file issues on github if this occurs.
